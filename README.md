ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Caroline Lundy 

My favorite things in life are coding, my dog Benji, hiking, and playing Mario Kart. 

Currently I am attending A 14-week Java coding bootcamp to learn how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming language.  

My previous role was a Customer Care Representative where I advocated for client success and collaborated with our tech team to solve complications. 
While I loved adminstering excellent customer service to my clients, I found myself curious about the magic behind each application and started learning to
code in my spare time. I fell inlove with the coding process and invested in myself by continuing my edcuation through the java bootcamp, Tech Elevator.

âœ¨My coding super-power is that I have a knack for seeing future potential errors while writing code. What's yours?âœ¨

Feel free to reach out to me!
